ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
F:\ProgramData\Copy of spatialite-android
                   -  -                  

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From Copy of spatialite-android:
* proguard.cfg
From Copy of spatialite-android-library:
* .DS_Store

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In Copy of spatialite-android-library:
* AndroidManifest.xml => Copyofspatialiteandroidlibrary\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => Copyofspatialiteandroidlibrary\src\main\assets
* jni\ => Copyofspatialiteandroidlibrary\src\main\jni\
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libjsqlite.so => Copyofspatialiteandroidlibrary\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libjsqlite.so
* libs\armeabi\libjsqlite.so => Copyofspatialiteandroidlibrary\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi\libjsqlite.so
* libs\x86\libjsqlite.so => Copyofspatialiteandroidlibrary\src\main\jniLibs\x86\libjsqlite.so
* lint.xml => Copyofspatialiteandroidlibrary\lint.xml
* res\ => Copyofspatialiteandroidlibrary\src\main\res\
* src\ => Copyofspatialiteandroidlibrary\src\main\java\
In Copy of spatialite-android:
* AndroidManifest.xml => Copyofspatialiteandroid\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => Copyofspatialiteandroid\src\main\assets\
* lint.xml => Copyofspatialiteandroid\lint.xml
* res\ => Copyofspatialiteandroid\src\main\res\
* src\ => Copyofspatialiteandroid\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
